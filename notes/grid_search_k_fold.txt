K Fold cross validation is to measure the performance of a model

Grid search - hyper parameter tuning, to find out the best combinations of hyper parameters
Ex: in SVM,linear model vs kernal. if the problem is linear then linear model will be shown after performing grid search else, kernal SVM will be shown.
