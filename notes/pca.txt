pca is a dimensionality redecution technique

if we want to represent project higher dimension data in the lower dimension, then use PCA

each component is a linear combination of all the features

each pca is orthogonal to each other, meaning - there is no correlation between two components


regardless of the dependendent/outcome variable, pca will identify principle components which are lower dimensional representation of actual data (which explains most of the variance in the data)

z1 = param1 * x1 + param2 * X2 + ... + paramN * Xn
these parameters are called loadings

All these parameters are normalized meaning sum of squares of these parameters are 1
